# Adversary Profile - Black Basta

## Description

Black Basta is considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) variant and was first identified in April
2022. Black Basta affiliates have impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure in
North America, Europe, and Australia. As of May 2024, Black Basta affiliates have impacted over 500
organizations globally.

Black Basta affiliates use common initial access techniques—such as phishing and exploiting known
vulnerabilities—and then employ a double-extortion model, both encrypting systems and exfiltrating
data

## Objective

As most campaigns are financially motivated, victims are usually given between 10 and 12 days to pay
the ransom before the ransomware group publishes their data on the Black Basta TOR site, Basta News.

## Operations Flow

If it helps you planning, make separate notes or use labels (e.g. victim-a, client-1, server-2) in
the tables below to document the operations flow for later use in a diagram ond/or the emulation plan.
It's also fine to leave this out for now and think about how to construct the operations flow out of
the techniques or procedures in this document once you create the emulation plan for the red team.

## Exploited CVEs / Vulnerabilities

***for the workshop we will not use any vulnerabilities/CVEs***

Please feel free to duplicate lines as needed. Not all vulnerabilities need to be present in the
adversary profile. If you want to find the ATT&CK technique a particular vulnerability enables you
can search ATT&CK for "Exploitation" or "Exploit".
